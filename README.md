# Build a small website with HTML, CSS and ES6.
# The website has to have a login screen and an upload page.
# Build the login form with webcomponents (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
# Only after a succesful login the user can go to the upload page (Simulate the login. No need to build a backend.)
# From the upload page user should be able to upload an image to a server (Again just simulate the request)
